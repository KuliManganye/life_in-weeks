LIFE IN WEEKS

This is a simple program that calculates how much time you have left in months, weeks days if you lived till you were 90 years old. 
The idea is to separate how much 90 years is in months, weeks and days. Then calculate your current age in months, weeks and days. Then subtract the results of your age to the results of 90 years then the result is how much you have left in months, weeks and days. 
Since the results of the calculations will be in integers, python does not allow you to combine strings and integers without using the format method.
